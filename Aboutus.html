        <p>I have to say the person who wrote the original article didn't really know what they were talking about. It was a strict interpretation of something that no one really agrees on. For example, who says that there can be only one supercar per company? (btw that is not what "super" means in latin, it means "above", which just refers to the high performance of these cars) I didnt read the rewrite yet but i suspect anything is better than the old version. -Bonus Onus 03:35, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)
            Ok, i read the rewrite, and i dont particularly like it, but i still think its better. Hopefully we can build on it a bit and improve it, so i recommend going back to the rewrite. Bonus Onus 03:40, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)
            Ahutch - the original was POV, poorly written, and just plain wrong. I strongly object to the revert and request that you re-revert it and edit it if you feel it needs work. As it stands, it is just plain opinionated junk. --SFoskett 13:30, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)
            the question is, who really knows what the qualificiations for a supercar are? there's no textbook about it. how do we know the truth?--Alhutch 18:38, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)
            
            That's why I attempted to write an article calling out the general qualifications without being POV and opinionated like the current article. This is an encyclopedia, and the current text simply cannot stand. --SFoskett 19:30, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)
            Agree with User:Sfoskett- His rewrite was very good, IMHO. The article as first (largely) written, besides being POV and unencyclopaedic, is flat-out ugly and hard to read because it's poorly formatted. The previous article also seems to set up too many rigid definitions, some of which conflict. They need to be vague and open, but still give the reader an idea about what a supercar is. I'm reverting it because it's trash as it stands. Prometheus235 20:21, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)
            there's a show on the history channel called automaniac. its hosted by bill goldberg. tomorrow's (wednesday the 15th) program is about supercars conveniently enough. its at 10:00 US Eastern time. i plan to watch. maybe this will give us some answers.--Alhutch 23:48, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
